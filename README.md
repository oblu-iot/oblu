This repository contains source codes and documents related to oblu

oblu is an Arduino compatible, miniaturized, low cost and opensource inertial sensor targeted towards wearable motion sensing applications. It provides a platform to construct and implement innovative ideas. oblu is a configurable development platform.

The feature rich oblu comes pre-programmed as a shoe-sensor (Pedestrian Dead Reckoning or PDR sensor) which is highly effective for navigation under a heavy tree canopy or in the urban locality surrounded by concrete buildings & trees or inside buildings where GPS gets iffy. Some other applications are gaming, AR/VR, self navigating robot, geo-sruvey, treatment of movement disorders, understanding physics of motion etc. The list is long.

oblu is based on opensource OpenShoe platform.
